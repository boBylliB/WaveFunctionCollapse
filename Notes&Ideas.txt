FEATURES:
- some sort of generation

- User creates a bunch of sprites (or edits from a template)
- User can then select certain tiles in a grid to force to be a certain sprite
- Wave function collapse fills in the rest

Task breakdown:
- Wave function collapse from list of sprites into grid
- Generation speed slider
- Tile constraints
- Sprite editing
- Tile visualization
